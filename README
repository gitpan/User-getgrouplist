User::getgrouplist
==================

Interface for libc function "getgrouplist".
Please see the respective function's man page for detailed information,
or visit the perldoc of this module.

getgrouplist is not a POSIX call; however, it exists on various UNIX-like
platforms, including Linux, many BSD variants, and Darwin (MacOS X). It
is known NOT to exist on Solaris, and Irix. Makefile.PL checks for the
call before building, and reports an error if your system does not support
it.


Installation
============
To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install


Bugs
====

None known.

Due to the nature of getgrouplist being a non-POSIX (non-standard) function,
the existence of the function does not automatically mean that it will work
in a defined behavior. Versions of this module up to and including 1.0.4
returned empty lists on OpenBSD and MacOS X (fixed with 1.1.0); other systems
that provide an implementation of getgrouplist may behave differently as well.
